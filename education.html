            <h3 class="center">Major: Computer Science &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minor: Architectural Studies &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pathway: Creativity</h3>
            <br>
            <p>I came to Conn thinking I wanted to major in film studies, but during the fall semester of my freshman year I took the introductory film course, and decided it wasn't for me. That same semester out of curiousity, I took the introductory computer science course because I have always enjoyed tinkering around with technology and I had never taken a computer science course before. I was instantly fascinated with coding and knew I wanted to major in computer science. I love the problem solving combined with the endless possibilities. My architecture minor came about because I was browsing the selection of minors and noticed that architecture only had 4 required classes. I can appreciate an attractive building, so I figured I'd give it a go. Last semester I took an art class and an architecture class, both of which count towards the minor (so I'm halfway done). I would consider myself a generally creative person, so the creativity pathway seemed like a logical choice for me. Ideally, I would be a member of the Ammerman Center for Arts and Technology, but they didn't accept my application. I'm not really sure what a pathway is or what I have to do for it, but if it allows me to harness computer science in a creative way, then I should enjoy it.</p>

        <h2>Hanover High School</h2>
        <h3>Hanover, NH</h3>
        <br>
        <p>I know high school was a long time ago and feels pretty irrelevant these days, but for the sake of practicing my web development skills and making a comprehensive biography website it feels appropriate to add. My town was too small to have a high school, so after 8th grade I had to decide where to go to high school. I chose Hanover High over my other options because it is a well respected public school, a few of my friends from travel club soccer were going there, and I could study German. I know it sounds weird, but I was a big fan of the German national soccer team, so I thought it would be really cool to learn the language. I met many of my closest friends in German class and I have a good relationship with the teacher to this day. Other than German class, a few highlights from high school include playing on the varsity soccer team, meeting some of my closest friends, and learning in a supportive and rigorous environment.</p>
