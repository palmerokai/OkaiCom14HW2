This site is a auto-biographical website with the goal of helping the user get to know me better. 
I figured this would be a good choice for the first website assignment as it will help you to better understand me and my work as we progress through the semester.

The main file (index.html) serves as the "home" page for the site, providing navigation to the three other pages on the site, as well as a few relevant external sites.
Each of the other three pages touches on an aspect of my life. Interests/hobbies, resume (professional life), and education.
All images used are mine, unless otherwise cited.
I tried my best to cite my sources not only for images, but for styling features as well.

  <ul>
    <li>HTML elements used in index.html: head, title, style, body, div, img, h1, h2, h3, p, a</li>
    <li>HTML elements used in interests.html: head, title, style, body, div, a, img, h1, h2, h3, p, table, caption, tr, th, td</li>

(it seems that you can write a README file in html. I used a list element. Kinda cool)
